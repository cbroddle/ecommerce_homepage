-Template for homepage of Ecommerce clothing website
-Includes header, footer, category menus, layout, email subscription input.

Concepts used:
Layout using HTML5 tags and CSS stylesheet
Design with CSS
Jquery(instead of vanilla JS) selectors with HTML and changing styles

Project experience:
I made a mockup of the page in Google Slides before I started coding. As I wrote code, I used Chrome dev tools in the browser to test my page and check that it looked the way I wanted.
W3schools and lecture notes were helpful references in writing JQuery script.
I used the validators for HTML and CSS to correct some minor errors.
